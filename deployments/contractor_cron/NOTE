Hello there everyone, all of this is currently the IT Git repo.  If there are changes that you need made to them, commit them here, and let Jared Griffith know so that he can copy them over to the IT Git scripts repo.  Eventually, the goal is to move this out of this here repo as with everything else in the deployments directory.
Thanks!
