        HTML is XML. Organization and maintenance of HTML is just as important as any other code.  HTML is the language we use to tell the computer what type of content we are trying to convey and we do so by writing semantic markup. Semantic markup allows us to describe our content, to the computer, through a list of comprehensive tags.

        Writing clean and elegant HTML is not as easy as it seems, but is not an impossible task either. The goal is to approach HTML in two easy steps:
    </p>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Use semantic tags to describe the content you want to display.</li>
        <li>Modify or wrap the content with additional containers to be appropriate for the design.</li>
    </ol>
