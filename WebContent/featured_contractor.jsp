		<p><strong>Bigge - An Industry Leader</strong><br>
		<p>Founded in 1916, Bigge has developed and maintained a solid
		tradition of excellence and quality in the heavy transport and lifting
		industry. Today, Bigge is a diversified equipment and project services
		company with a commitment to achieving customer success and leadership
		in their industry.</p>

		<p>Bigge operates throughout the United States, and in key
		geographies worldwide, providing innovative solutions and quality
		equipment for heavy transport, heavy lift and other customer needs.
		Bigge has been richly involved in the development of California; they
		hauled steel for the building of the Golden Gate Bridge and
		transported Liberty ship sections during World War II. Bigge has
		contributed to the erection of fossil and nuclear power stations and
		every refinery in Northern California. Bigge recently installed the
		1800-ton tub-girders on the transition section of the new San
		Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge, a Caltrans record!</p>

		<p>Bigge has been recognized an unprecedented 22 times with the
		Outstanding Rigging Job of the Year award by the Specialized Carriers
		& Rigging Association. Jim Coenen, Bigge’s Safety Manager, attributes
		this to a core set of values. <strong>“Safety First is not
		just a slogan, but a value at Bigge. Values don’t change with the
		daily business needs, they remain a constant. Our primary core values
		are Safety, Productivity and Quality.”</strong> Coenen has over 20 years
		experience in safety and health in the heavy lifting industry, and has
		seen the safety industry grow and mature greatly. <strong>“No
		longer can a contractor work for a sophisticated customer in a
		competitive environment without emphasizing safety,”</strong> and safety is
		what Bigge emphasizes, under Coenen’s direction.</p>

		<p>As a strong supporter of PICS, Bigge recognizes the value that
		PICS brings to the industry, both the contractor and the operator.
		Coenen is able to <strong>“provide a consistent, quality
		audit to all our clients through PICS. We support the
		consortium idea for owners and will continue to point new potential
		consortium members to PICS. They are a leader in the
		industry, and we are proud to be associated with
		PICS.”</strong></p>
