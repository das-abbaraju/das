<div>
<p>Contractor is defined as any organization with a Contractor account with PICS.</p>

<p>Full refunds will be offered only if Contractor's credit card is accidentally double charged or charged in error.  For example, if Contractor submits payment twice for the same membership, or if Contractor pays for membership with a credit card and also sends a check to PICS for membership.</p>

<p>Partial refunds are offered if contractor decides within 7 days of registration that they registered in error and contacts PICS within 7 days.  Partial refund is defined as a refund of the membership fee.  The Activation fee (i.e. the $99 registration fee) will not be refunded for any reason.  The annual membership fee (starting at $99 through $1,999) can be refunded if and only if no audit has been commenced by PICS and Contractor has contacted PICS within 7 days of registration.  Audits that have commenced that prevent the refund are the following:  Annual Update Audit, PQF Verification, InsureGUARD&trade;, Manual Audit, Implementation Audit, or any other audit requested by operator.</p>

<p>No refunds are offered for a renewal charge.  It is Contractor's responsibility to contact PICS and request to deactivate membership before the Membership Date -- listed in the Edit Account page -- should Contractor choose not to renew their account.  PICS will send a renewal reminder to Contractor at least 7 days before the credit card is charged to the email listed in the Contractor profile.  It is the contractor's responsibility to ensure the contact email is a valid email address.</p>

<p>Partial refunds will be paid using the same method contractor used to pay, For example, if Contractor used a credit card to pay, then refund will be issued with a credit card.</p>
