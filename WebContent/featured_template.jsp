		Committing to Improve</strong><br>
		Liz McDaniel, Huntsman’s Vice President of EHS, Americas, initiated a Contractor Evaluation Improvement effort in January 2008, and PICS was part of Huntsman’s plan. Huntsman has partnered with PICS to help achieve their goal to create a safer, more efficient workplace for both contractors and Huntsman employees.  Another key element to the plan was a global implementation of a behavioral-based safety program beginning in 2006, along with commitment from top management to create an award-winning safety culture at Huntsman.  </p>
		<p align="justify"><strong>
		Achieving Goals</strong><br>
		Huntsman Corporation recently announced that 2008 marked the lowest OSHA rate of occupational injuries in the company’s history.  Peter R. Huntsman, President and CEO of Huntsman Corporation, stated, <strong>&ldquo;I am very pleased with the culture of continuous improvement at Huntsman, especially as it relates to the safety of the associates and contractors at each of our sites. These investments in safety are among the most important we can make.&ldquo;</strong></p>
		<p align="justify"><strong>
		Forging Relationships</strong><br>
		McDaniel discussed how PICS has enabled Huntsman Sites in North America to continue its legacy of safety excellence:   <strong>&ldquo;We view our contractors as partners in our safety systems and safe behaviors.  It is of the utmost importance to ensure that our contracting partners take their safety systems and their associates’ safe behaviors as seriously as Huntsman does.  Huntsman is constantly innovating in regards to safety excellence and the PICS effort allowed a ready-to-use platform to improve our Contractor Evaluation program.  Instead of building an internal database with Huntsman-based contractors, PICS allowed us instant access to contractors who already met our safety standards without any effort on our part.  We were screening contractors to a higher standard inside of two months after partnering with PICS. &ldquo;</strong></p>
		<p align="justify"><strong>
		Leveraging Experience</strong><br>
		McDaniel, an Environmental, Health and Safety professional for 27 years in the petrochemicals field, strongly supports continuous improvements in the EHS area. Huntsman’s culture includes improvement of safety for everyone -- associates and contractors, on our sites.  McDaniel moved through her career from being a site-based contributor committed to EHS excellence to the Vice President of EHS for Americas Region.  Working in a regional role has allowed McDaniel to incorporate regional programs such as PICS.  McDaniel’s personal and professional commitment to EHS excellence continues to drive her and her team to new and better programs and systems.</p>
		<p align="justify"><strong>
		Creating Value</strong><br>
		Selecting service providers can be difficult, and when Liz was asked why she and her team selected PICS for contractor prequalification, she responded with positive referrals from other current customers in dealing with PICS. She explained further, <strong>&ldquo;We were very happy to see that many of our existing contractors already were members of the PICS consortium.  The fact that they had already passed the PICS audit confirmed that our contractor evaluation initiative was moving in the right direction.  PICS also allowed our sites to gain instant access to a functioning database, which Huntsman otherwise would have built internally at great expense.  PICS helped Huntsman elevate to the next level in contractor evaluation excellence overnight.&ldquo;</strong></p>
