		Achieving Goals</strong><br>
		John Driscoll, manager of health, safety and security at
		ConocoPhillips’ San Francisco Refinery in Rodeo, California, recently
		was head of the team that helped ConocoPhillips join the PICS
		consortium for contractor prequalification services. They have
		partnered with PICS to help achieve their goal to create a safer, more
		efficient workplace. The San Francisco Refinery produces close to
		80,000 barrels of crude oil per day, and is one of 12 US refineries
		owned by ConocoPhillips.</p>
		<p align="justify">Driscoll explained how PICS is going to help
		the team achieve their goals: <br>
		<strong>&ldquo;In a very competitive business it is essential
		to identify, evaluate and execute value- added process changes to make
		improvements.  Our existing process for safety & financial evaluation
		and qualification of contractors for our work site is something we
		very much value, and for years have resisted changing because of our
		confidence in our people and our methods.  In the last year, due both
		to changing internal resource demands and an increased emphasis
		on continuous improvement we got serious about making and drawing
		conclusions—and making the change if appropriate.  My conclusion was
		that PICS can do what we do, and can do it with a higher efficiency
		level.  Making the decision was then easy, and making the change,
		although always a challenge, is going smoothly.&ldquo;</strong></p>
		<p align="justify">Driscoll, a safety professional for 26 years in
		Refining, Chemicals and Oil Production, understands the benefits of
		prequalifying contractors. Most importantly, he understands the
		importance of teaming up with contractors to create a better safety
		culture for everyone. Driscoll has been at the San Francisco Refinery
		for 6 years and through personal commitment has ensured that the risks
		and relative safety are on an ongoing trend of improvement. Being a
		leader and board member of CAER (Community Awareness and Emergency
		Response) helps him be more aware of local Contra Costa County issues,
		and improve the health and safety of employees and residents alike.</p>
		<p align="justify">Selecting service providers can be difficult,
		and when Driscoll was asked why he and his team selected PICS for
		contractor prequalification, he responded with positive referrals from
		other current customers in dealing with com.picsauditing.PICS. He
		explained further, <strong>&ldquo;We chose PICS primarily
		based on comments and recommendation from other COP refining
		facilities and a couple of local competitors using the service. We
		actually began discussions and relationship building over two years
		ago, and the quality of the people with PICS eventually made an
		impact. I have found John Moreland & Jared Smith to be very
		professional and customer focused.  To date, I've been completely
		satisfied with both the timeliness and quality of response and service
		from them personally.&ldquo;</strong></p>
