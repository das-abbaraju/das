</head>
<body>
<p>Employers are not required to keep OSHA injury and illness
records if the company had
<ul>
	<li>10 or fewer employees at all times during the last calendar
	year</li>
	<li>and/or for any establishment classified in the SIC codes
	below, unless they are asked in writing to do so by OSHA, the Bureau of
	Labor Statistics (BLS), or a state agency operating under the authority
	of OSHA or the BLS.</li>
</ul>
<p>All employers, including those partially exempted by reason of
company size or industry classification, must report to OSHA any
workplace incident that results in a fatality or the hospitalization of
