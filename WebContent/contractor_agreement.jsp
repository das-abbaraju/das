<b><u>DISCLAIMER AND INDEMNITY</u></b>
<p>As the duly authorized representative of your company that has been delegated the task of filling out the requested
forms, you agree that your company will defend, indemnify and hold PICS harmless from any claim, loss, liability or
expense that PICS may incur relating to your company's participation in the PICS program, including any claim, loss,
liability or expense made by a third party accessing the information provided by your company. The sole exception to the
foregoing disclaimer and indemnity shall be any claim, loss, liability or expense that is attributable to the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of PICS. Without limiting the foregoing, your company agrees that PICS shall, in no event
or circumstance, be liable for any loss or damage, direct, indirect or consequential, that your company may incur arising
from or related in any way to the PICS audit and/or the use of the PICS website.</p>
<p>While PICS will endeavor to accurately record the information received from you into your company's account appearing
on the PICS website, PICS shall have no responsibility for any claim, loss, liability or expense, direct, indirect or
consequential, arising out of or related to any errors or omissions in the information contained in the online PICS audit
for your company. Upon logging in or by request, your company will be provided a completed copy of any audit that PICS
has performed on your company as it will appear on PICS's online website. It shall be your responsibility to review the
information contained in the completed audits for your company and to verify that the information contained in the
audit form is and remains complete and accurate. You further agree to promptly notify PICS of any errors or omissions in
the information contained in the PICS website.</p>
<p>Listing on the PICS website does not guarantee acceptance of work from any client. It is understood these audits are for
the purpose of gathering the required documentation by PICS for review by potential clients. PICS is not responsible for
record retention. Unless specifically requested in writing to have your documentation returned, PICS has the right to
dispose of the records.</p><br/>

<b><u>USER AGREEMENT</u></b>
<p>You will be issued a username and password to access your company's inputted data. It is your responsibility to keep
this username and password confidential and private. PICS will not share your username and password data with any
third party, and regardless of circumstances you cannot share your username and/or password with a third party with
the sole exception that the third party is contractually acting as your agent to assist you through the PICS process. Any
violation of this user agreement will result in your account being either temporarily or permanently deactivated.</p><br/>

<b><u>PRIVACY POLICY</u></b>
<p>PICS' privacy policy can be accessed here as well as from the payment option page
<a href="http://www.picsorganizer.com/privacy_policy.jsp">(http://www.picsorganizer.com/privacy_policy.jsp)</a>.</p><br/>

<b><u>CONFIDENTIALITY</u></b>
<p>In addition to the linked privacy policy, PICS recognizes the expected confidentiality and sensitivity of the data that is
entered through the PICS website.</p>
<p>Sensitive data is defined as the following: your company's Prequalification Form (PQF), specific Insurance information,
any and all data gathered during an audit (including but not limited to a Desktop Audit, Office Audit, Field Audit, Integrity
Management Audit, etc), EMR and OSHA data. Non-sensitive data is defined as your company's name, description of
services, which states you operate in and have offices in, contact information of your company's listed main point of
contact, your company's logo.</p>
<p>PICS is a password-protected website. Your company's Sensitive and Non-sensitive data will be held behind this
password protection.</p>
<p>Sensitive Data will be shared only with authorized users from operators appearing on your "facility list" which are linked
to your account. You control which operators are linked to your account and can review anytime by logging in to your
account. At any time you can add or remove any operator from the facility list by either calling in to Customer Service
(800-506-7427) or controlling it using the web interface. Any user from an operator not listed on your facility can not
access your Sensitive Data. Other Contractors do not have access to your Sensitive Data.</p>
<p>Non-Sensitive Data will be used to assist Operators who are searching for potential bidders. Only Operators listed on the
PICS Facility list will be able to view this Non-Sensitive Data. In other words, even your Non-Sensitive Data is not public
data, but is password protected and shared only with PICS consortium operator members.</p>
<p>In an effort to help you gain more work with PICS consortium operator members, authorized users can add your
contractor account to the approved contractor list of the operator. This generates a notification email to your primary
user, stating which operator added your company and when. If you do not wish to associate your account with that
operator, you may remove your account from their approved contractor list by contacting PICS Customer Service, in
which case the Operator will be notified that your company requested to be removed from the Operator's approved
contractor list.</p><br/>

<b><u>REFUND POLICY</u></b>
<p>PICS refund policy can be accessed here as well from as the payment options page
<a href="http://www.picsorganizer.com/refund_policy.jsp">(http://www.picsorganizer.com/refund_policy.jsp)</a></p>
