<h1>Help - Red Flag Report</h1>
<hr/>
<h2 id="RFRFlagTest">Red Flag Criteria</h2>
<p>You have <strong>complete control</strong> over which questions you want to show up in your Red Flag Report,
  and what answers will cause a contractor to be <strong>flagged</strong>.  You can edit this 
  informations on the Red Flag Criteria Report.  There are 2
  sections - <strong>OSHA</strong> Questions, and other <strong>PQF questions</strong>.
  A flag will appear on your contractor list when the data entered by the contractor causes the 
  <strong>Flag Test</strong> to be <strong>TRUE</strong>. For example:
  <ul>
    <li>If the <strong>question</strong> is: 'Do you perform background investigations and screening on your employees?'
      <br><img src="images/help/flagTest1.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>You want this to <strong>trigger</strong> when they do <strong>NOT</strong> perform background tests</li>
    <li>To achieve this, under the Flag Test column, select the Equal Sign (=) from the first drop down, 
      and 'No' from the second.  Remeber, the contractor is flagged if this critiria is <strong>True</strong>
      <br><img src="images/help/flagTest2.jpg" border="2" hspace="10" vspace="10">
    </li>
    <li>You must also select the <strong>check box</strong> under the 'Include?' column for this question to be included 
      in your Red Flag Report
      <br><img src="images/help/flagTest3.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>This will cause a <strong>flag</strong> to appear next to the question if your criteria is true, i.e. if they 
      <strong>answered</strong> the question with <strong>'No'</strong> in this case
      <br><img src="images/help/flagTest4.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>The Red Flag Report for that contractor will show an overall flagged status that is the 
      <strong>most strict</strong> out
      of all the questions. If none of the criteria was flagged at all, then they will show a 
      <strong>Green</strong> flag. If any questions are flagged with an Amber flag but no 
      Red flags, then the status will be <strong>Amber</strong>.  Any red flags
      will cause the contractor's overall flagged status to be <strong>Red</strong>.
      <br><img src="images/help/flagTest5.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>Additionally, adding a contractor to a Waived or Forced Flag List will cause them to have a Green or Red flag, 
      respectively

  </ul>

<h2 id="RFRWaivedForcedFlag">Waived/Forced Flag List</h2>
<p>The Waived/Forced Flag List section gives your organization the opportunity to overide, either positively
  or negatively, the flagged status for a contractor.  For example:
  <ul>
    <li>If they get flagged because of an answer to a specific question, and you still want them to be approved,
      you can override their red/amber flag by clicking the 'Add' button in the <strong>Waived Flag List</strong> row
      <br><img src="images/help/waivedForcedFlag1.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>They can not be on the list indefinitely.  For this reason, you must select an <strong>Expiration Date</strong>
      of the form mm/dd/yy (ie 3/25/09).  You can click on the calendar icon to select the date
      <br><img src="images/help/waivedForcedFlag2.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>Their Forced Flag Status, along with the expiration date, will then show in the <strong>Status column</strong>
      <br><img src="images/help/waivedForcedFlag3.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>To <strong>remove</strong> a contractor from either list, click on the 'Remove' Button
      <br><img src="images/help/waivedForcedFlag4.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>If a contractor passes your Red Flag Criteria, yet you would still like them to be flagged to prevent
      them from working at any of your facilities, you may add them to the <strong>Forced Flag List</strong>
        by selecting an expiration date, and clicking the 'Add' button in that row
      <br><img src="images/help/waivedForcedFlag5.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>Once the expiration date arrives, you do not have to do anything to removed the contractor from your Forced Flag
      or Waived Flag list.  They will automatically be removed
    </li>
  </ul>
</p>
<hr/>
<h2 id="RFRNotes">Notes</h2>
<p>The <strong>Notes</strong> section of the Red Flag Report is to help your company communicate internally about
  a specific contractor, especially if you have several different facilities.
  <ul>
    <li><br><img src="images/help/notes1.jpg"></li>
    <li><strong>Add a note</strong> by entering your text in the 'New Note' box, and clicking the 'Add Note' button
      <br><img src="images/help/notes2.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>The note is then added to the running list of Notes.  The person's <strong>name</strong> who wrote 
    the note, and the <strong>date</strong>, are <strong>automatically</strong> logged as well.
      <br><img src="images/help/notes3.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>Whenever a contractor is added to or removed from a <strong>Forced/Waived Flag list</strong>, it is also 
    <strong>automatically recorded</strong> in the notes section
      <br><img src="images/help/notes4.jpg">
    </li>
    <li>You can <strong>remove</strong> a note from the list by clicking the 'Delete' link.  However, the note
      is still <strong>archived</strong> in the PICS system for future reference if needed
      <br><img src="images/help/notes5.jpg">

  </ul>
