		</strong>OSHA reminds employers that beginning Feb. 1, they must post a summary
		of the total number of job-related injuries and illnesses that
		occurred during 2006. Employers are only required to post OSHA Form
		300A (summary), not the OSHA 300 log. The summary must be posted from
		Feb. 1 to April 30, 2007.</p>
		<p>"This is an excellent time for employers to review their 300
		logs and determine where injuries and illnesses are occurring and
		determine a strategy to reduce and hopefully eliminate these safety
		and health hazards," said OSHA Administrator Ed Foulke.</p>
		<p>The summary must list the total number of job-related injuries
		and illnesses that occurred in 2006 and were logged on the OSHA 300
		form. Information about the annual average number of employees and
		total hours worked during the calendar year also is required to assist
		in calculating incidence rates. Companies with no recordable injuries
		or illnesses in 2006 must post the form with zeroes on the total line.
		All summaries must be certified by a company executive.</p>
		<p>The form is to be displayed in a common area wherever notices
		to employees are usually posted. A copy of the summary must be made
		available to employees who move from worksite to worksite, such as
		construction employees and employees who do not report to any fixed
		establishment on a regular basis.</p>
		<p>Employers with 10 or fewer employees and employers in certain
		industry groups are normally exempt from federal OSHA injury and
		illness recordkeeping and posting requirements. A complete list of
		exempt industries in the retail, services, finance and real estate
		sectors is posted on the OSHA Web site.</p>
		<p>Exempted employers may still be selected by the Department of
		Labor's Bureau of Labor Statistics to participate in an annual
		statistical survey. All employers covered by OSHA need to comply with
		safety and health standards and must report verbally within eight
		hours to the nearest OSHA office all accidents that result in one or
		more fatalities or in the hospitalization of three or more employees.</p>
		<p>Copies of the OSHA Forms 300 and 300A are available on the OSHA
		Recordkeeping Web page (<A
