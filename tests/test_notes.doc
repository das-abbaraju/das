On August 5 your safety audit that was conducted with PICS on 8/5/05 will expire. To maintain an active status we will need to schedule a safety audit again. We would like to schedule your audit for Thursday July 31, at 2pm. One of our auditors will come to your office in Santa Fe Springs. Once we schedule the audit, more information will be provided on how to prepare for the audit. Please let me know if this date will work.
